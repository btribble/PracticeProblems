# Saying Hello

Create a program that prompts you for your name and prints a greeting using your name.

## Sample Output


Brandon
Hello, Brandon, nice to meet you!

## Constraint

Keep the input, string concatenation, and output sperate.

## Challenges 
 * Write a version of the program without using any variables.
 * Write a version of the program that displays different greetings for different people.  This would be a good challenge to try after you've completed the exercises relating to "making decisions" and "data structures".
