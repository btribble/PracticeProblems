## Area of a Rectangular Room

Create a program that calculates the area of a room.  Prompt the user for the length and width of the room in feet. Then display the area in both square feet and square meters. 

## Example flow

I: What is the length of the room in feet?
I: What is the width of the room in feet?
O: You entered the dimensions of x feet by y feet.  The area is z square feet. or z square meters

m^2 = f^2 * 0.09290304

## Constraints

* Keep the calculations seperate from the output. 
* Use a constant to hold the conversion factor. 

## Challenges 

* Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values.  Don't allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric. 
* Create a new version of the program that allows you to choose feet or meters for your inputs. 
* Implement this program as a GUI that automatically updates the values when any value changes.
