## Printing Quotes

Create a program that prompts for a quote and an author.  Display the quotation and author. 

## Constraints 

* Use a single output statement to produce this output using appropriate string-escaping techniques for quotes.
* If your language supports string interpolation or string substituion, don't use it for this exercise, Use string concatenation instead.

## Challenge

Modify this program so that instead of prompting for quotes from the user you create a structure that holds quotes and ther associated attributions and then display all of the qoutes using the format in the example.  An array of maps would be a good choice.
