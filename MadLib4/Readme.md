## Mad Libs

Create a simple mad-lib program that prompts for a noun, a verb, an adverb, and an adjective and injects those into a story that you create.

## Example output

Enter a noun:
Enter a Verb:
Enter an adjective:
Enter and adverb:
Do you walk your blue dog quickly? That's hillarious!

## Constraints

* Use a single output statement for this program. 
* If your language supports interpolation or string substitution, use it to build up the output.

## Challenges

* Add more inputs to the program to expand the story.
* Implement a branching story, where the answers to the quiestions determine how the story is constructed.
