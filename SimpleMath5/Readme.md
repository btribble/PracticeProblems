## Simple Math 

Write a program that prompts the user for two numbers.  Print the sum, difference, product, and quotient of those numbers.

## Example Output 

x + y = z
x - y = z
x * y = z
x / y = z

## Constraints

* Values coming from users will be strings.  Ensure that you convert these values to numbers before doing math.
* Keep the inputs and outputs separate from numerical conversions and other processing .
* Generate a single output statement with line breaks in the appropriate spots.

## Challenges 

* Revise the program to ensure that inputs are entered as numeric values.  Don't allow the user to proceed if the value entered is not numeric. 
* Don't allow the user to enter a negative number.
* Break the program into functions that do the computations.
* Implement this program as a GUI program that automatically updates the values when any value changes.
