## Retirement Calculator

Create a program that determines how many years you have left until retirement, and the year you can retire.  It should prompt for your current age and the age you want to retire and display the output. 

## Constraints

* Again, be sure to convert the input to numerical data before doing any math.
* Don't hard-code the current year into your program.  Get it from the system time via your programming language.

## Challenge

* Handle situations where the program returns a negative number by stating that the user can already retire.
